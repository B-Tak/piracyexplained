                <H2>Who I am:</H2>
                <p>Hey I'm Bastiaan, student software-development at ROC Horizon College Alkmaar.</p>

                <h2> Why have I chosen this topic?</h2>
                <p>I have chosen this topic because I have always been interested in the works behind piracy. I was also
                    interested in how "internet-pirates" stay anonymous. In some cases piracy could be considered
                    ethical, while still illegal within most jurisdiction and advised against. Forms of it include sites
                    that exists to archive data on the internet.</p>
